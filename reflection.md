Seunghyeon Kim, Reflection

I assigned the information that computer should have (name, type, price, etc.) and the operating device for the resale shop.
It was difficult for me to approach how to attribute the information at first, but it became easier after I understood how the attribution in the main function works.

My advice is: 
1) Assign easy name. Easy naming helps you to recognize each different value.
2) Try to run the python file. Although you are not sure of your result, just try. You can know where has an error/mistake on your code that would reduce time to work.
